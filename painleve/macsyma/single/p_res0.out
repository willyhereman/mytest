AT THE END OF THE COMPUTATIONS THE FOLLOWING ARE AVAILABLE:

* U VALUE(S)

  (type uval[j,k,l] where 1 <= j <=  1 and 0 <= k <=  [COUNTERT ]
                                                               1

  and 1 <= l <=  [1] )

  j stands for j_th alpha,k stands for u[k],l stands for

  l_th solution set for u[0] 

* ALPHA VALUE(S)

  (type alpha[j] where 1 <= j <=  1 )

  j stands for j_th alpha

* COMPATIBILITY CONDITION(S)

  (type compcond[j,k] where 1 <= j <=  1 and 1 <= k <=  [1] )

  j stands for j_th alpha,k stands for k_th solution set for u[0]

* RESONANCE(S)

  (type res[j,k] where 1 <= j <=  1 and 1 <= k <=  [1] )

  j stands for j_th alpha,k stands for k_th solution set for u[0]
